# MySchedule

## Description
MySchedule is a REST API application for planing. You can write down your long-term/year/month/week/day plans, view and sumarize them. 
(or it will be if I'll find frontend dev to do that :D)

Looking for a front dev who want to make this app looking a bit more presentable.
