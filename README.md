<strong>1) GoalScheduler ðŸ“”</strong>

Web REST application, the main purpose of this application is to mirror a real-life goal planner with some fancy features which computers are able to do. 
There is a front-end developer - Konrad DulÄ™ba which is creating a front side of the application, so it might be deployed soon. 

Functionalities of actual version:
- registration - creating your account, adjusting your profile with informaction or profile image 
- logging in (security is working properly - there is no chance of calling other user's resources)
- creating, modifying or deleting long-term/year/month/week/day plans
- creating summaries of year/month/week/day

Future functionalities I plan to add in next versions:
- creating a repeatable day plans, which when we log in, will be filled in the current day automatically
- creating a diagrams filled with data from summaries to let users monitor their progress
- creating a set of achivements based on application functionalities (like logging for 10 days in a row, fullfilling 100 day plans etc.)
- adding possibility of setting imporatnce of plans, based on that sort the way of plans being displayed
- creating a funciontality of assigning the plans which are lower in hierachy (DayPlan<WeekPlan<...<LongTermPlan), to the higher in hierarchy plans 
to create a connection between them, for purpose of monitoring the progress of achieving the complicated plans which consist of the smaller ones
